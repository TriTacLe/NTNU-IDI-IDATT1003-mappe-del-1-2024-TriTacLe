# Project Description

This Java-based application, developed using Maven, assists users in efficiently managing their food ingredients and recipes 🥕. Key features include:
- **Ingredient Management**: Add, remove, and list ingredients with specified quantities and expiration dates, helping to minimize food waste 📅.
- **Recipe Management**: Create and store recipes in a digital cookbook, associating them with specific ingredients 🧑🏽‍🍳.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Recommend recipes based on the ingredients currently available in storage, facilitating convenient meal planning.

The application employs Java's robust libraries and Maven for dependency management, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience. Its modular design allows for future enhancements, such as database integration or the addition of a graphical user interface.
